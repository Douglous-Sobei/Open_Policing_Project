# Open_Policing_Project
This project explores the Stanford Open Policing Project dataset and analyze the impact of gender on police behavior. They've collected data from 31 US states, but this project I will be focusing on data from the state of Rhode Island.

**Summary of the dataset**

1. What I discovered from the different features in the dataset
- There were more male stop and search than females and maybe more male driver in general
- There are more speed violation and very few seat belt violations
- Most stop outcomes end with citation and there were a few passenger arrest
- Most of the stops does not actually involve searching
- We have very few drug related cases during the stop and search

2. It was discovered that women get stop more often than men for speeding offences, e.g. for 100 male drivers only about 52 will be stop for speeding and about 66 female will be stop for same offences.

3. There is higher chance of been search as a male driver.

4. The dataset clearly show that most violation result in a Ticket and the issueance of it's, is not gender bias

5. There is a rising trend for drugs related stops as the year progresses, and it was confirmed that the rise is not dependent on the numbers of stop and search that was conducted

6. Most offences/violations are speeding, followed by moving violation and Equipment

7. Also, Seatbelt violation take least amount of time duration, follow by speeding and other follow suit
